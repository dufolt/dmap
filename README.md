===

* `dmap` is a universal namespace
* `dmap` has a well-defined command-line query interface
* the basic function of `dmap` is to execute `dmap <dpath>`

* `dmap` is defined in terms of the Ethereum chain state
* `dmap` develops in an ad-hoc manner
* the `dmap` program is optimized around the resulting universal state

* `dpath` is the mini-language for traversing the dmap.
* `dpath` is extensible and future-proof
* `dpath` incorporates knowledge about the structure of the dmap after it develops

* source bootstrap (git hash on chain, `dmap update` verifies it before linking)
